# Quip Pro Quo
## An open-ended, fill-in-the-blank game, where users upvote answers by humor level.
### Made by Sean Byrne, Ryan Julier, &amp; GG Gonzalez.



### Overview
  An open-ended, fill-in-the-blank game, similar to Things or Cards Against Humanity, where users provide their own answers to questions or prompts, with the intention of being upvoted according to humor level. Users click through a category, then a question, to post an answer they find accurate, witty, funny or what-have-you. Users can place an upvote once per answer, and the answers with the most votes are pushed to the top of the answer list.

### Deployment
  Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that we used as our web application deployment model. To view live, visit https://quip-pro-quo-frontend.herokuapp.com/ for frontend and https://quip-pro-quo.herokuapp.com/ for backend.


### Approach
  We used mainly Javascript and Ruby to make a single-page web application. We wanted to make a fun app where users an add their own answers to a database of all users answers, and vote on whose is best.

### Technical Difficulties
  We had a good deal of trouble perfecting the authentication process, deploying to Heroku, allowing users to upvote an answer only once, and keeping the site one page. We worked through all issues as a team and triumphed over adversity.

### Future Implementations
  In the future, we would like to implement log-in function via social media sites like Facebook, the ability to post answers to Facebook, user profiles with avatars that get added to each post, earning badges or awards when you reach milestones of likes or answers, the addition of the app to App Store and Google Play.
