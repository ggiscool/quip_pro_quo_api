# Quip Pro Quo
## An open-ended, fill-in-the-blank game, where answers are upvoted by humor level.
### Made by Sean Byrne, Ryan Julier, &amp; GG Gonzalez.



### Overview
  An open-ended, fill-in-the-blank game, similar to Things or Cards Against Humanity, where users provide their own answers to questions or prompts, with the intention of being upvoted according to humor level.

### Deployment
  Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that I used as my web application deployment model. To view live, visit https://xxxxxxxxxxx.herokuapp.com/.


### Approach
  We used CRUD. The dependencies we used included Bcrypt, Express, JSON.

### Technical Difficulties
  We had a good deal of trouble perfecting the authentication process, deploying to Heroku, allowing users to upvote an answer only once, keeping the site one page,

### Future Implementations
  Log-in via social media sites, like Facebook. Be able to post answers to Facebook. Have  profile, with an image that gets added to each post. Have badges or awards you get when you reach milestones, like a certain number of likes or answers. Add to App Store and Google Play.

### Tech Used
  -HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js, Postgres, Ruby and Rails.
  -Atom and Sublime for text-editing.
  -Postman for testing.
